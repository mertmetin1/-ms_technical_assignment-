What would you use for this task, please write your detailed answer with exact solution? 

first  I create a DB named export_domains for simulate the situation then I import sample data in table named products
second I connect my DB and get colmns both of device typr and stats_acces_Link frome products    
third I create a regex patern then I check for all domain to exist in patern if exist then Ä± matched and append both of domain and device type in a dict named domains_by_device  
last  I shut the connect and output the pure domains
I used MySQL(lib:pymysql) Database to keep data in  
I used librariy "re" for make regex pattern 
I was checking all character of link rows with my own created alphabet array and for loop 
but I got stuck and then I find the library and learn quickly 
so I  implied on my code to optimze it  
and I used some AI tools to make difficult(for Q6 ) sql queeries or optimize the code
